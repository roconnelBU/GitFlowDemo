# Feature branches 


# May branch off from:
# develop
# Must merge back into:
# develop
# Branch naming convention:
# anything except master, develop, release-*, or hotfix-*
# Feature branches (or sometimes called topic branches) are used to develop new features for the upcoming or a distant future release. When starting development of a feature, the target release in which this feature will be incorporated may well be unknown at that point. The essence of a feature branch is that it exists as long as the feature is in development, but will eventually be merged back into develop (to definitely add the new feature to the upcoming release) or discarded (in case of a disappointing experiment).

# Feature branches typically exist in developer repos only, not in origin.
